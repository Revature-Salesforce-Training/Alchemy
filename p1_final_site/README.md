Alchemy Project 1
Project Description
Creating a LWC Experience Cloud site & imperative business solutions.

	Goals:
	-Create a LWC single-page application containing some feature(s) relevant to the business through Experience Cloud.
	-Use Apex classes to be used in conjunction with the feature(s).
	Utilize additional declarative customization required to support the feature(s).
	-Create Apex Triggers for the business that meet best practices.
	-Provide an implementation of Sales & Service Cloud to include the unique tools and capabilities of these cloud apps as a part of the orgs implementation, including Assignment Rules, Auto-Response Rules, Escalation Rules, Campaigns, Products, and Price books.
	
	Deployment:
	-Successfully deploy the experience site in addition to other customizations during the presentation.

	Presentation and Styling:
	-The developers must ensure that the experience cloud site contains uniform customized styling to denote it as a polished and branded experience. Styling will require the use of CSS and leveraging SLDS with consistent styling for HTML elements. Additionally, the developer will be required to have the entire project on a GitHub repo and follow reasonable branching procedures. Finally, as part of the live demo, the developer will clone the master branch of the repo and push the customization to a fresh org.
	
  -We created a company called Revo and made a customer facing website to sell customizable shoes. We successfully modeled a business-to-customer design using Lightning Web Components, meeting and exceeding all expectations. We were able to crate a community site deployed on the Experience Cloud with business relevant features, Apex classes, and declarative customizations. Each team member was responsible for coding a feature, updating a branch on the code repository, and following package-based development.
